## Hi, I'm Robin Heinze

I'm a software engineer, engineering leader, crocheter, baker, reader, Formula 1 watcher, and mom of two located in Beaverton, Oregon.

I fell in love with coding while building Excel macros for a paper company (no not that paper company), before making my way to Ruby on Rails and eventually landing happily in the React Native world. I'm currently Director of Engineering at [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red), navigating the transition from IC to leadership, and I'm a co-host of [React Native Radio](https://reactnativeradio.com), our React Native podcast.
